# Case Study of Robinhood Markets

## Overview and Origin

(Wikipedia, n.d.)Robinhood Markets is an American financial services company headquartered in Menlo Park, California. Robinhood was founded in March 2015 by Vladimir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt. 

According to (Our Story, n.d.), Vladimir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt met in Stanford who developed finance companies which sell trading software to hedge funds. They started Robinhood Markets with a view of providing everyone with access to financial markets as most Americans were charged commission for every trade. 

As per (Huang, 2015), Robinhood is a Silicon Valley upstart which was initially funded by its founders Vladimir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt during its development stages. Later it was launched on Apple Inc’s App store in March 2015 and later was backed by Andreessen Horowitz along with Jared Letto and SnoopDogg.  

According to (Wikipedia, n.d.), Robbinhood raised $110 Million at a valuation by DST Global, In 2018, Robinhood raised a funding of $539 million in venture capital funding. 
(Forbes, n.d.) Stated that the revenue of Robinhood in 2021 Q1 is $420 million which was increased by 340% compared to previous year. Robinhood declared that it has US$ 98 Billion in assets under management at the end of Q4 2021.

## Business Activities:

As per (StackShare, n.d.) Robinhood mentioned that it started with a simple idea to use technology and cut out extra costs that other financial services use like legacy technology, hundreds of storefronts. 
(Fast Company, n.d.) mentioned that Robinhood wanted to help everyone to enter into financial markets with its mission to democratize finance as most of the Wall Street Firms Charge commission for every trade leaving their investors with less profits even though the firms pay nothing to trade. 
 (Curry, 2022) added that the intended customers of Robinhood are high frequency traders, young people in between the age of 18 and 29 years and financial brokers. (Fast Company, n.d.) released statistics stating that the total number of users in 2021 is 22.5 million and the total number of users in 2022 is 15.6 million. (Curry, 2022) stated that each user generated an average revenue of US $64 in 2021 Q4. 

Upon analysis it is found that the high number of users on its platform is because Robinhood offers all of its trades at a 0% commission unlike any other competitors when it was founded. 
According to (Davis, 2022), Robinhood offers  free crypto trading which is offered by only few brokers. However when compared with other platforms who are offering the same service, cost of trading on Robinhood are completely negligible. As per (Davis, 2022), the unfair advantage which Robinhood provides to its customers is IPO access to its customers which was provided only to financial organizations by its competitors and Robinhood doesn’t have an account minimum which plays a strategic role in attracting its users onto the platform. 

According to information mentioned on (StackShare, n.d.) it was found that Robinhood uses some basic technologies like Amazon EC2, Kotlin, NGINX, Faust, Elasticsearch, Docker, prometheus, Vagrant, Salt, Vault, Logstash, Jenkins, Kibana, Google Analytics, Faust, Redux.
